Proposed architecture for the software:

1. Mobile App (ActiveSite App):
- User Interface: interact with the system, set goals, view personal information, and monitor the health metrics.
- App Data: Store user-specific data like profiles, personal information, goals and sensor data for offline access

2. Sensor:
- Data Communication: sensor will communicate directly with the mobile app to transmit real-time sensor data, including glucose levels, hydration levels, and other metrics.

3. Database Server:
- Data Storage: store and manage the persistent data of the system, profiles, goals and historical sensor data.
- Data Communication: the app will communicate with the database server via APIs to store and retrieve data.


To implement the database server, we can consider popular database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB. These databases provide robust features for data storage, retrieval, and management. Additionally, we can utilize a web server with an API framework to handle the communication between the mobile app and the database server. These are some API capabilities to consider:

1. Node.js with Express: Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime that can be used with the Express.js framework to build scalable and efficient APIs. Large and active community and offers excellent performance.

2. Ruby on Rails: A popular web framework written in Ruby. It provides a comprehensive set of tools and conventions for building APIs quickly and efficiently.

3. Django: A high-level Python web framework that follows the model-view-controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It has built-in support for creating APIs and offers robust features for database integration.
