# Software-Engineering

**Objective of the subject**: this course covers the basics of the most used Software Engineering process.

● Includes the needs for methodologies of software development: Analysis of software requirements, design, implementation and validation

● With an overview of the basic elements of Object-Oriented Design: UML, OO abstraction, testing tools and methodologies and model views
#
**Conceptual definitions**: What are the software engineering, a methodology and the OO design? An informal definition of these concepts are:

● Software engineering: discipline to develop software with a good organization and following a specific methodology.

● A methodology is a set of rules, methods and techniques to achieve an objective.

● Object-Oriented Design is a technique to model a software system using the principles of the OO programming.
#
**General objective**: Provide an overall and ordered view of the software development process which does not only covers programming. We will introduce the main activities that constitute the development process. Acquires a vision of what processes in software development:

● How to manage a given software project.

● How to model the software.

● How to implement and validate the results of the project.
#
**Contents**: This course will be ‘project-oriented’. Although the course will have theory, exercises and practices; the objective is to show the common path that is followed to complete the different tasks of software development. Therefore, focus on practices!

● Practicum is the most relevant part of the course.

● The Theory Lectures will serve only to introduce de concepts.

● Exercises will be carried out to understand how to execute the tasks.
#
**Topics**

• Block 0. Subject introduction

• Block 1. Introduction: Software engineering principles, history, process, methods, tools and development paradigms

• Block 2. Software management principles: Tools and methodologies, Agile management: SCRUM

• Block 3. Software modeling: Software Analysis (Requirements definition, UML) and design (concepts, modular)

• Block 4. Software quality: Validation concepts and Software Testing
#
**Practicum**: During the whole course you will (partially) develop a medium level project:

● Subject proposed by the students, but approved by the supervisor. Groups of 3-4 people. 9 sessions of 2 hours.

● One initial brainstorming session to select the subject of the project.

● Second session to present the subject and receive approval.

● Third session to setup the tools of the environment and start to work.

● Four sessions to achieve different goals. In seminars the supervisor will discuss individually the group work.

● Two final sessions (4hours-10groups) to present the results of the project
#
**Working methodology**: Scrum relevant topics are the product backlog (list of requirements of the software to develop), sprint backlog (a group of requirements used during the sprint), scrum-master (manage the tasks, do daily monitoring…), product-owner (it is usually the client, supervisor), daily-meeting (it is explained briefly the progress) and sprint-review (each session is discussed more in detail the progress)

● Software tools: online repository (github), task manager (trello), simple UML modeler (plantuml) and documentation
