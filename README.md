# Software-Engineering

**Practicum**: During the whole course you will (partially) develop a medium level project:

● Subject proposed by the students, but approved by the supervisor. Groups of 3-4 people. 9 sessions of 2 hours.

● One initial brainstorming session to select the subject of the project.

● Second session to present the subject and receive approval.

● Third session to setup the tools of the environment and start to work.

● Four sessions to achieve different goals. In seminars the supervisor will discuss individually the group work.

● Two final sessions (4hours-10groups) to present the results of the project
#
**Working methodology**: Scrum relevant topics are the product backlog (list of requirements of the software to develop), sprint backlog (a group of requirements used during the sprint), scrum-master (manage the tasks, do daily monitoring…), product-owner (it is usually the client, supervisor), daily-meeting (it is explained briefly the progress) and sprint-review (each session is discussed more in detail the progress)

● Software tools: online repository (github), task manager (trello), simple UML modeler (plantuml) and documentation
