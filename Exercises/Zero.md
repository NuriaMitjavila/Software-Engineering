**Objective of the exercise**: This exercise is an informal approach to the tasks involved in software development. It focuses on these aspects:

● Which tasks need to be performed to develop new software? Hint: coding the code is not the only task necessary to create software.

● Which results should be obtained from each task? Hint: the tasks should be able to be chained together.

● And how to plan the different tasks to achieve the goal? Hint: the goal is to quantify the effort to perform each task.
#
**Performing the exercise**: Without prior knowledge, you should try to:

● List all the tasks required to complete the development. Tip: these tasks will range from analysis to deployment, including management.

● Outlines the objectives to be completed within each task. Try to describe in depth as much as you can.

● Provide a work schedule of the tasks to be performed. The idea is to focus on collaboration and management of the developer group.
#
**Deliverables**: This is an evaluable exercise, so deliverables are mandatory. You should create a PDF that provides the required information:

● First try to analyze the project in order to understand it and extract all relevant elements.

● Organize your work to complete this exercise.

● Reuse as much as you can to write the document
#
**Problem domain**: Implement the software platform for an online food delivery service. This includes management of the delivery, client accounts, payments, transport costs, platform administration, etc.
